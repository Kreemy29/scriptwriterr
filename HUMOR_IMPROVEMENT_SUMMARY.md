# AI Script Studio - Humor Improvement Summary

## Problem Identified

The original system prompts were generating **cringe content** instead of sophisticated humor:
- Generic "spicy" content without intelligence
- High school level humor and pickup lines  
- Repetitive visual clichÃ©s (lip biting, winking, etc.)
- Surface-level sexual content without clever context
- Basic "thirst trap" scenarios without wit

## Solution Implemented

Updated all system prompts to focus on **Dark Humor & Pop Culture Satire**:

### 1. **Dark Comedy Focus**
- Cynical observations about modern life
- Existential dread with laughs
- Self-deprecating but clever humor
- Mental health jokes done tastefully

### 2. **Pop Culture Satire** 
- Mock current trends and influencer culture
- Satirize social media absurdity
- Comment on Gen Z/millennial behavior
- Reference internet culture intelligently

### 3. **College-Level Wit**
- References to psychology, philosophy, current events
- Memes with depth and cultural awareness
- Adult themes: career anxiety, economic struggles, dating disasters
- Sophisticated wordplay and cultural callbacks

## Content Examples - Before vs After

### BEFORE (Cringe):
```
"POV: You're so hot that..."
"When he sees you in this outfit..."
"Rating guys by how they..."
[Generic sexy poses and facial expressions]
```

### AFTER (Sophisticated):
```
"POV: You're having a breakdown but make it aesthetic"
"Rating my life choices like they're Netflix shows" 
"Explaining my student debt to my houseplants"
"When your therapist asks how you're doing but you've been doom-scrolling for 6 hours"
"Me pretending my life is together for LinkedIn vs reality"
"Ranking my trauma responses by how useful they are in corporate America"
```

## Key Improvements Made

### System Prompt Changes:
1. **Eliminated cringe content rules**:
   - NO basic "thirst trap" content
   - NO surface-level sexual content without clever context
   - NO repetitive visual clichÃ©s
   - NO high school humor or pickup lines

2. **Added sophistication requirements**:
   - Every script must have a SMART ANGLE
   - Cultural commentary or social satire required
   - Use current memes/trends but SUBVERT them intelligently
   - Self-awareness and irony are key

3. **Enhanced visual intelligence**:
   - Actions should support comedic concept, not just be "sexy poses"
   - Props/settings enhance satirical message
   - Physical comedy should be clever, not just attractive

### Content Categories Now Include:
- **Existential Comedy**: Modern life absurdities
- **Career Satire**: Work culture, LinkedIn personas, hustle culture
- **Dating Disasters**: Modern dating app culture
- **Social Media Satire**: Influencer culture, performative wellness
- **Economic Anxiety**: Student debt, housing costs, financial struggles
- **Mental Health Humor**: Therapy culture, self-care trends

## Technical Implementation

### Files Updated:
- `src/rag_integration.py` - Main system prompts for both enhanced and fast generation
- User prompt templates updated to emphasize intelligence requirements

### Prompt Structure:
1. **System Prompt**: Defines the sophisticated humor style
2. **Content Examples**: Shows the type of intelligent content expected
3. **Forbidden Content**: Explicitly bans cringe and juvenile humor
4. **Sophistication Requirements**: Intelligence checks for all content
5. **Visual Intelligence**: Smart use of visuals to support comedy

## Expected Results

The AI should now generate content that:
- **Makes people think while they laugh**
- **References current culture intelligently** 
- **Has deeper observations about modern life**
- **Avoids cringey, juvenile humor**
- **Uses sophisticated wordplay and cultural references**
- **Balances adult themes with platform compliance**

## Quality Checks

Every generated script should pass these tests:
1. **Intelligence Test**: Does it reference culture/current events with insight?
2. **Sophistication Test**: Would a college-educated adult find this funny?
3. **Originality Test**: Does it subvert trends rather than follow them?
4. **Relatability Test**: Does it comment on shared modern experiences?
5. **Visual Intelligence Test**: Do the visual elements serve the comedy?

## Examples of New Content Style

### Mental Health + Social Media Satire:

    "Crying with perfect makeup still intact", 
    "Journaling in aesthetically pleasing notebook",
    "Taking a mirror selfie mid-breakdown with good lighting"
  ],
  "voiceover": "Step 1: Arrange your breakdown props aesthetically. Step 2: Cry with your ring light on. Step 3: Post about growth and healing.",
  "caption": "Mental health but make it content âœ¨ Who else has perfected the art of the photogenic breakdown?",
  "hashtags": ["#mentalhealthawareness", "#selfcare", "#authenticity", "#growth"],
  "cta": "Comment 'aesthetic' if you've turned your problems into content"
}
```

### Career Anxiety + Pop Culture:
```json

```

This transformation ensures the AI generates **intelligent, culturally aware content** that resonates with sophisticated audiences rather than producing cringe content.
